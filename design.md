# System Design Document — Sample App CI/CD Solution

## 1. Overview

This document describes the design and operational flow of the CI/CD system for the Sample App project. The system automates code validation, testing, containerization, and delivery through GitHub Actions, Docker, and the GitHub Container Registry (GHCR). The implementation emphasizes reliability, reproducibility, and transparency in software delivery, ensuring consistent behavior across local, staging, and production environments.

---

## 2. Objectives

- Automate the build, test, and release processes with GitHub Actions.
- Guarantee test coverage and build reproducibility through automated checks.
- Use Docker containers as a uniform runtime environment for both local and remote executions.
- Publish versioned images to GHCR for traceable deployments.
- Enforce security and compliance via permissions isolation and secret management.
- Enable local parity, allowing developers to replicate CI/CD behaviors on their own systems.

---

## 3. CI/CD Architecture

The pipeline is divided into two workflows:

1. **Continuous Integration (ci.yml)** — triggered on pull requests and direct pushes.
2. **Continuous Delivery (cd.yml)** — triggered upon successful CI completion on the main branch.

These workflows enforce a controlled and observable path from code submission to deployment-ready image publication.

---

## 4. Continuous Integration (CI)

### 4.1 Trigger Conditions

- On `push` and `pull_request` to `main` and `develop` branches.
- Manual dispatch via the GitHub Actions interface.

### 4.2 Execution Matrix

Runs against multiple Python versions (`3.10`, `3.11`, `3.12`) to validate cross-version compatibility.

### 4.3 Workflow Summary

| Stage                  | Description                                                                                                    | Tools / Artifacts                     |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Checkout               | Fetches repository content using shallow clone for optimized network use.                                      | `actions/checkout@v4`                 |
| Python Setup           | Configures Python versions defined in matrix.                                                                  | `actions/setup-python@v5`             |
| Install Dependencies   | Installs project requirements via `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Cached based on hash of requirements.txt. | Python `pip`, cache                   |
| Lint and Static Checks | Runs `flake8` to ensure style consistency and code health. Logs and warnings in job summary.                   | `flake8` logs                         |
| Unit Tests             | Executes `pytest` for core logic and CLI entrypoint tests.                                                     | `junit.xml`, `coverage.xml` artifacts |
| Build Docker Image     | Builds container image for the current commit SHA.                                                             | `Dockerfile`, local build cache       |
| Push to GHCR           | Authenticates using GitHub token and publishes to `ghcr.io/<org>/sample-app:<sha>`.                            | GHCR image, metadata manifest         |
| Upload Artifacts       | Persists test results and build logs for traceability.                                                         | GitHub Actions artifact store         |

### 4.4 Output

- Verified application correctness via automated testing.
- Published Docker image to GHCR tagged with commit SHA.
- Test results and reports stored as artifacts.
- CI results surfaced directly in pull request comments.

## 5. Continuous Delivery (CD)

### 5.1 Trigger Conditions

- Triggered automatically upon successful CI completion on `main` branch (`workflow_run` event).
- Executable manually through GitHub’s workflow dispatch mechanism.

### 5.2 Workflow Summary

| Stage                            | Description                                                                                  | Tools / Artifacts                            |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Checkout and Metadata Extraction | Retrieves repository context and references commit metadata from triggering workflow.        | `actions/checkout@v4`                        |
| Login to GHCR                    | Authenticates using GitHub Actions token to access previously published images.              | `docker/login-action@v3`                     |
| Pull and Verify Image            | Pulls corresponding Docker image using commit SHA tag.                                       | `docker pull ghcr.io/<org>/sample-app:<sha>` |
| Run Smoke Tests (Optional)       | Placeholder for runtime validation or environment sanity checks.                             | Logs and test outputs                        |
| Simulated Deployment             | Represents future deployment step (to ECS, AKS, or similar). Currently a stub for extension. | Deployment logs                              |
| Upload Logs and Results          | Stores logs from CD execution for traceability and compliance.                               | Artifact store, workflow summary             |

### 5.3 Output

- Verified and traceable image promotion event.
- Structured log artifacts tied to originating commit SHA.
- Secure and auditable delivery process ready for integration with real infrastructure deployments.

---

## 6. Docker Integration

The Docker architecture provides a reproducible runtime and deployment vehicle.

**Key Design Principles:**

- Base image: `python:3.12-slim` to minimize size and attack surface.
- Non-root user execution for security compliance.
- Layer caching aligned with dependency changes to optimize build time.
- Explicit tagging strategy using commit SHA for traceability (`sample-app:<sha>`).
- Consistent local build command parity with CI process (`docker build -t sample-app:dev .`).

---

## 7. Security and Compliance

| Aspect                | Mechanism                                                                              |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Secrets Management    | All secrets stored in GitHub Encrypted Secrets; access restricted to workflow scope.   |
| Least Privilege       | Workflow permissions limited to required scopes (`contents: read`, `packages: write`). |
| Image Integrity       | Each Docker image tagged immutably with commit SHA; GHCR provides audit trail.         |
| Pipeline Auditability | GitHub Actions retains logs, artifacts, and environment data for post-run analysis.    |
| Dependency Hygiene    | Dependencies installed from locked versions; no external download during runtime.      |

---

## 8. Local Development Parity

Developers can replicate CI behavior locally via:

- Executing tests via `pytest` or `docker run sample-app:dev`.
- Building images with identical Dockerfile and Python environment.
- Inspecting logs and results equivalent to CI outputs.
- Managing `.env` and `.gitignore` to isolate local configuration safely.

This ensures that pre-commit validation mirrors automated CI execution, minimizing environment drift.

## 9. Future Enhancements

| Enhancement                     | Description                                                        |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Semantic Versioning Integration | Auto-generate version tags from PR merges using GitHub tags.       |
| SonarQube / CodeQL Integration  | Enhance code quality assurance via static and dynamic analysis.    |
| Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)    | Extend CD pipeline to deploy via Terraform or GitHub Environments. |
| Multi-Stage Deployments         | Introduce staging and production environments with approval gates. |
| Automated Changelog Generation  | Derive release notes directly from commits and PR metadata.        |
